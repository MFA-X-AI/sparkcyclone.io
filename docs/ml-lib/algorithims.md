# Supported Algorithms

CycloneML integrates wrappers for the following algorithms:

- Support Vector Classification
- Linear Support Vector Classification
- Logistic Regression
- Na√Øve Bayes
- Gaussian Mixture Clustering
- K-Means Clustering and Classification
- Latent Dirichlet Allocation
- Spectral Clustering
- Word2Vec
- Factorization Machine
- FP-Growth
- Alternating Least Squares
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree
- Gradient Boosted Decision Tree
- Random Forest

Note: Since the Scala API of Frovedis has some limitations that wrappers cannot compensate for, we still sometimes
need to modify existing code to account for those differences.
